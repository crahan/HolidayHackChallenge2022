# Easter Eggs

Every year my plan is to find all the Easter eggs and every year I fail miserably. It's simply amazing how many things you can find once you start looking around for them, like movie references, jokes, nods to popular culture, memes, secret areas, references to past Holiday Hack Challenge, and funny WebSocket response messages. Below, in no particular order, are just a few.


## Staging area music

It's Lord of the Rings movie music! Hobbit score?

Objective 7, Jolly CI/CD, notes "You may have heard that some evil Sporcs have opened up a web-store selling  counterfeit banners and flags of the many noble houses found in the land of the North! They have leveraged some dastardly technology to power their storefront, and this technology is known as PHP!"

Houses, the North, etc.

## Footer on the NFT website

*This is an artist's rendering of the clubhouse we're considering building if we end up, like, rollin' in it after this NFT thing takes off. This does not represent the actual clubhouse which right now is kinda just, like, the bottom level of my parent's cave. I moved home about ten years ago, after I got, like, laid-off from my job working Sporc Squad for Beast Buy. My boss, Chordclak, was a total lamer... Anyway, that picture isn't the real clubhouse. My old girlfriend, Glanchorf, she drew that. I always told her that she should go to art school and stuff because, like, she was really talented and all, but she just kept working at Burgher King and eventually she dumped me for that lamer Chordclak. I kept the picture though, and decided to use it on this site.

And just in case you're reading this Chordclak, I'm gonna be rich and you suck.
