# Exploitation via AWS CLI

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [AWS 201 terminal](https://hhc22-wetty.kringlecon.com/?&challenge=aws201)


## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Flex some more advanced AWS CLI skills to escalate privileges! Help Gerty Snowburrow in the Cloud Ring to get hints for this challenge.

??? quote "Sulfrod"
    Hey! You - come here!<br/>
    You look like someone who knows how to do this nerd stuff.<br/>
    I need my terminal to be stronger, like me!<br/>
    *flexes*<br/>
    You're gonna do that for me so I can bust into this cloud machine thing.


## Hints

??? tip "IAM Privilege Escalation"
    You can try `s3api` or `lambda` service commands, but [Chris Elgee's talk](https://youtu.be/t-xDvVUialo) on AWS and IAM might be a good start!

??? tip "(Attached) User Policies"
    AWS [inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) pertain to one identity while managed policies can be attached to many identities.


## Solution

### Question 1

!!! question "Question"
    Use Trufflehog to find credentials in the Gitlab instance at [https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git](https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git).<br/>
    Configure these credentials for `us-east-1` and then run `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

We can use the AWS credentials found in the [previous challenge](./o12.md) to configure the AWS CLI environment. Run [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) and enter `AKIAAIDAYRANYAHGQOHD`, `e95qToloszIgO9dNBsQMQsc5/foiPdKunPJwc1rL`, and *us-east-1* as the access key, secret key, and region values. Next, use [`aws sts get-caller-identity`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) to confirm everything's working as expected.

![Answer 1](../img/objectives/o13/answer1.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    Use the AWS credentials obtained via [TruffleHog](./o12.md) to configure the AWS CLI environment.


### Question 2

!!! question "Question"
    Managed (think: shared) policies can be attached to multiple users. Use the AWS CLI to find any policies attached to your user.<br/>
    The `aws iam` command to list attached user policies can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html).<br/>
    **Hint:** it is NOT `list-user-policies`.

Use the [`list-attached-user-policies`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/list-attached-user-policies.html) command, with the *haug* user name found in the [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) from question 1, to list the policies.

![Answer 2](../img/objectives/o13/answer2.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name haug`


### Question 3

!!! question "Question"
    Now, view or `get` the policy that is attached to your user.<br/>
    The `aws iam` command to get a policy can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html).

The output from question 2 contains a policy ARN. Use this value with the [`get-policy`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/get-policy.html) command to view the policy.

![Answer 3](../img/objectives/o13/answer3.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws iam get-policy --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY"`


### Question 4

!!! question "Question"
    Attached policies can have multiple versions. View the default version of this policy.<br/>
    The `aws iam` command to get a policy version can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html).

Use the *v1* default version ID from question 3 with the [`get-policy-version`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/get-policy-version.html) command to show the default version details.

![Answer 4](../img/objectives/o13/answer4.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY" --version-id "v1"`


### Question 5

!!! question "Question"
    Inline policies are policies that are unique to a particular identity or resource. Use the AWS CLI to list the inline policies associated with your user.<br/>
    The `aws iam` command to list user policies can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html).<br/>
    **Hint:** it is NOT `list-attached-user-policies`.

To list inline policies we need to use the [`list-user-policies`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/list-user-policies.html) command with *haug* as the user name.

![Answer 5](../img/objectives/o13/answer5.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws iam list-user-policies --user-name haug`


### Question 6

!!! question "Question"
    Now, use the AWS CLI to get the only inline policy for your user.<br/>
    The `aws iam` command to get a user policy can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html).

The [`get-user-policy`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/get-user-policy.html) command will print the details of the *S3Perms* inline policy, found in the output of question 5.

![Answer 6](../img/objectives/o13/answer6.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws iam get-user-policy --user-name haug --policy-name "S3Perms"`


### Question 7

!!! question "Question"
    The inline user policy named `S3Perms` disclosed the name of an S3 bucket that you have permissions to list objects. List those objects!<br/>
    The `aws s3api` command to list objects in an s3 bucket can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/index.html).

To list the objects in the *smogmachines3* bucket, shown in the output of question 6, we can use the [`list-objects`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/list-objects.html) command.

![Answer 7](../img/objectives/o13/answer7.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws s3api list-objects --bucket "smogmachines3"`


### Question 8

!!! question "Question"
    The attached user policy provided you several Lambda privileges. Use the AWS CLI to list Lambda functions.<br/>
    The `aws lambda` command to list functions can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/lambda/index.html).

The `lambda` command set contains a [`list-functions`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/lambda/list-functions.html) command that will list the lambda functions.

![Answer 8](../img/objectives/o13/answer8.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws lambda list-functions`


### Question 9

!!! question "Question"
    Lambda functions can have public URLs from which they are directly accessible.<br/>
    Use the AWS CLI to get the configuration containing the public URL of the Lambda function.<br/>
    The `aws lambda` command to get the function URL config can be found [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/lambda/index.html).

To show the public URL details of a specific lambda function, we can use the [`get-function-url-config`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/lambda/get-function-url-config.html) command.

![Answer 9](../img/objectives/o13/answer9.png){ class=border }

!!! success "Answer"
    `aws lambda get-function-url-config --function-name "smogmachine_lambda"`

    Ha! Now I have the ring!<br/>
    This computer stuff sure is easy if you just make someone do it for you.<br/>
    Wait.. the computer gave you the ring? Gah, whatever.<br/>
    This never happened, got it? Now beat it, nerd!
