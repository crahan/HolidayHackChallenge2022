    Welcome to the North Pole, KringleCon, and the 2022 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! I’m Jingle Ringford, one of Santa’s elves.<br/>
    Santa asked me to come here and give you a short orientation to this festive event.<br/>
    Before you move forward through the gate, I’ll ask you to accomplish a few simple tasks.<br/>

## Solution

To solve this challenge we just need to follow Jingle Ringford's instructions. Each task is designed to help explain part of the game mechanics: talk to Jingle Ringford, get our badge, pick up the WiFi dongle, and use the terminal to open the gate. Start by clicking on Jingle Ringford's avatar until three dots appear, indicating the end of the conversation.

    First things first, here's your badge! It's the five golden rings in the middle of your avatar.<br/>
    Great - now you're official!<br/>
    Click on the badge on your avatar. That’s where you will see your Objectives, Hints, and gathered Items for the Holiday Hack Challenge.<br/>
    We’ve also got handy links to the KringleCon talks and more there for you!<br/>
    Next, click on that machine to the left and create a crypto wallet for yourself. Don't lose that key!<br/>

!!! note "New domain name<span id="new-domain-name"></span>"
    The wallet creation terminal is running under a new kringle.co.in domain for which [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/?q=kringle.co.in) tells us there are several subdomains available:

    - prod-santa-magic.kringle.co.in
    - prod-ktm-create.kringle.co.in -> create wallet
    - prod-ktm.kringle.co.in -> KringleCoin Teller Machine
    - prod-hats-vending.kringle.co.in -> buy a hat
    - prod-blockbrowser.kringle.co.in -> browse ledger

    On https://prod-santa-magic.kringle.co.in/ especially there's some interesting JavaScript code that holds a conversation with Santa (if you provide an `id` field in the URL, the JavaScript will run and Santa will start his conversation):

    !!! quote "Santa"
        ["So, I've heard a rumor that you lost the<br>Private Key to your KringleCoin wallet.", 5000],
        ["I must admit, I'm more than a little disappointed in you.", 4000],
        ["I'm sure that you were told that if you lose your Private Key,<br>it CAN'T be recovered...", 5000],
        ["Well, I suppose that isn't entirely true...", 4000],
        ["Christmas Magic can do even those things that are,<br>otherwise, impossible.", 5000],
        ["But you've been naughty, and before I'll use<br>Christmas Magic to recover your key,<br>you need to prove yourself!", 6000],
        ["I'm going to need you to go on a quest...", 4000],
        ["First, you'll need to find Yukon Cornelius,<br>and help him track down what he calls a <b>Bumble</b>.", 6000],
        ["Take a tooth from the <b>Bumble</b> and carry it deep<br>into the Misty Mountains, and trade it with Gwairhair,<br>Windlord of the Great Eagles, for one of his feathers.", 9000],
        ["If Gwairhair is reluctant to trade,<br>tell him that I have sent you.", 6000],
        ["With that feather, you must scale the walls of Sombertown,<br>and find the home of Burgermeister Meisterburger.", 7000],
        ["Take the feather, and tickle Burgermeister Meisterburger,<br>so that he may laugh and feel joy!", 6000],
        ["Once he feels joy, he'll happily give you<br>safe passage to the Isle of Misfit Toys...", 5000],
        ["There, you must find Dolly, and tell her that a horrible<br>mistake has been made and she's perfectly fine...", 8000],
        ["Not a misfit at all...", 4000],
        ["Thus, having set right one of the greatest wrongs<br>of the Christmas season, you will<br>have proved yourself worthy!", 8000],
        ["Then, if you come back here, I will tell you...", 5000],
        ["", 0],
        ["...", 5000],

    If you specify an ID in the URL, at the end of the conversation Santa will tell you what your key value is. Or alternatively you could run the `query()` JavaScript function directly in the web browser console to skip the chatter and just get your key! Thanks, Santa! :)
