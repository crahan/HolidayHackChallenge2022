    Umm, can I help you?<br/>
    Me? I'm Jill Underpole, thank you very much.<br/>
    I'm working on this here smoke terminal.<br/>
    Cloud? Sure, whatever you want to call it.<br/>
    Anyway, you're welcome to try this out, if you think you know what you're doing.<br/>
    You'll have to learn some basics about the AWS command line interface (CLI) to be successful though.


## Hints

??? tip "AWS Whoami?"
    In the AWS command line (CLI), the Secure Token Service or [STS](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) has one very useful function.


## Solution

Solving this challenge is a matter of following the step-by-step terminal instructions. Start by typing `aws help` to bring up the AWS CLI help information. To exit back to the command line, press ++"q"++. Next, run `aws configure` to [configure the AWS CLI installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) and enter `AKQAAYRKO7A5Q5XUY2IY`, `qzTscgNdcdwIo/soPKPoJn9sBrl5eMQQL19iO5uf`, and *us-east-1* as the access key, secret key, and region values. The final step is to use `aws sts get-caller-identity` to retrieve [details about the IAM user](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) whose credentials we used to configure the AWS CLI tool.

## Response

    Wait, you got it done, didn't you?<br/>
    Ok, consider me impressed. You could probably help Gerty, too.<br/>
    The first trick'll be running the Trufflehog tool.<br/>
    It's as good at sniffing out secrets as I am at finding mushrooms!<br/>
    After that, it's just a matter of getting to the secret the tool found.<br/>
    I'd bet a basket of portobellos you'll get this done!
